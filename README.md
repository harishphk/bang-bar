# Bang Bar

Make searches and site lookups faster by using short commands called "bangs" directly from your browser.

Bang Bar lets you jump straight to searches or sites by typing a short trigger followed by your terms.

What you can do (user-friendly)

- Use bangs from the address bar: type `!` then a short trigger and your search.
- Use bangs while searching: start a search with a bang to be redirected to the right site.
- Get helpful suggestions as you type so you can pick the right bang quickly.
- If a bang isn't available, you get a normal web search so you always get results.

How to use

- From the address bar (omnibox):
   - Type `!` then the bang trigger, a space, then your terms.
   - Examples:
      - `!g cats` → Google search for "cats"
      - `!w JavaScript` → Wikipedia search for "JavaScript"
      - `!gh copilot` → GitHub search for "copilot"

- Or just type `!trigger query` directly:
   - Begin your query with a bang trigger (for example `!yt lo-fi beats`) and press Enter.
   - The extension detects the bang and takes you directly to the matching site or search.

Common bangs (examples)

- `!g <terms>` — Google search (e.g. `!g weather`)
- `!w <terms>` — Wikipedia search (e.g. `!w nodejs`)
- `!gh <terms>` — GitHub search (e.g. `!gh copilot`)
- `!yt <terms>` — YouTube search (e.g. `!yt lo-fi beats`)

What happens if a bang isn't recognized

- Bang Bar will perform a normal web search using your query so you still get useful results.

Tips

- Start with `!` in the address bar to see suggestions and commonly used bangs.
- Use the arrow keys to select a suggestion before pressing Enter.

Need help?

- Reinstall or update the extension from your browser's extensions/settings if something doesn't behave as expected.
- If you still need help, include your browser name/version and a short description while creating an github issue
