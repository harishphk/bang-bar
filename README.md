# Bang Bar

Make searches and site lookups faster using short commands called "bangs" directly from your browser. Inspired by the bangs feature of DuckDuckGo, Bang Bar allows you to jump straight to sites or search results in one keystroke.

Supports all bangs(13k+) in DuckDuckGo but fully offline, private and ligtening fast.

Type a bang trigger followed by your search terms to go directly to the right site or search.

* **Omnibox Bangs**: Type `! + trigger + search terms` in the browser address bar and press Enter.
* **OmniSearch**: Type `!!<space>`, then enter `trigger + search term` to activate suggestions and search directly from the omnibox; the extension redirects automatically.
